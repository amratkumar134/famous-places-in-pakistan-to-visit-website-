                        <p class="place_desc">Though it has had a rough past, the present and future of Swat Valley are shining very bright. This stunning valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is something straight out of a fairy tale.

                            Think bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting shades of blue so clear and bright you wouldn’t have thought them real </p>

                    <p class="place_desc">If you live in Pakistan – or have read anything about the country – it’s almost certain you’ve come across the name Hunza. Don’t let the word ‘valley’ confuse you, though – Hunza is actually a massive district made up of numerous valleys and villages. One part of the ancient Silk Road, here are some of the most beautiful sights in Hunza:</p>

                <p class="place_desc">Hingol National Park is technically in Pakistan, but it looks more like a Martian planet! The park is over 6,000-square-kilometres and contains incredibly unique rock formations, vast canyons, numerous animal species, and even a mud volcano.

                    What’s more, part of the National Park hugs the coast, adding the ocean to all its other assets. Though totally out-of-this-world in its looks, Hingol is only 3.5 hours from Karachi, Pakistan’s most populous city.</p>

            <p class="place_desc"> The Kalash Valleys, comprised of Bumboret, Rumbur, and Birir, are home to the Kalash people, a religious and ethnic minority in Pakistan with their own beliefs, culture and language. The valleys they live in are certainly some of the most beautiful places in Pakistan – not just for their natural splendour, but also for the beauty of the Kalash themselves.

                The valley of Rumbur is particularly stunning.  </p>

            <p class="place_desc">Islamabad might be a glitzy ‘new’ city, but did you know it also has a vast array of hills perfect for climbing? The Margala Hills are spread out over over 12,000 hectares and contain multiple hiking and running trails.

                Ascending to the various peaks of the range show off Islamabad in ways you might not have known were possible. There are few places in Pakistan that remain so close to the city yet so deeply connected to nature.</p>

            <p class="place_desc">A lake that doesn’t look real… Even when you’re standing right in front of it. Attabad was born out of tragedy when a massive landslide occurred in 2010. The flow of the Hunza River was blocked, and the now-famous lake was created in its wake. Its bright-blue turquoise waters make the it one of the most beautiful places in Pakistan.</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="place_desc">Thought all the Mughal relics were in Punjab? Think again! The Shah Jahan Mosque – also known as the Jamia Masjid – is located in Thatta, a town in Pakistan’s Sindh province. It’s widely known for having the most elaborate display of tile work in all of South Asia. Blue and sandstone colours adorn the interior of the mosque and are sure to wow all who visit.

                The mosque was commissioned by Shah Jahan when he sought refuge in Thatta back in 1647 and somehow remains in amazing shape today. </p>
